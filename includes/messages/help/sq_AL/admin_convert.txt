<h1>Conversions/Exports</h1>
<p>Here you can manage conversions of various format of files of Volumes/Items to other format as well as the export of the volumes of your PMB database.</p>
<p>The conversion procedure allows to convert from a UNIMARC, USMARC, BCDI or XML PMB to another UNIMARC or XML PMB format.
If the final conversion format is UNIMARC, you can then import the result into PMB. 
Otherwise, you can download the result. <br />
<strong>Warning : 	transfer from a format to another can causes losses of information.</strong></p>
<p>The Export from PMB database is done in the form of bibliographic data including items using 995 standard 
from the ADBDP. You can convert the result in UNIMARC records or XML PMB.</p>
