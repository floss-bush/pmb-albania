<h2>database cleanup</h2>
<p>This feature allows you to keep the application's database up-to-date.  Great care has been taken to eliminate any possibilities of data loss. Among the tools made available by this feature are the ability to "clean up" and regenerate the indices used for the searches, and to eliminate data which are unnecessary for the functioning of the application. You should use these tools, perhaps, in case of problems with the data.</p>
