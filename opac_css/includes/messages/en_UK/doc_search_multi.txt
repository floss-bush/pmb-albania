<h2>Advanced Search</h2>
<p><strong>Advanced search allows you to combine several criteria to create a precise search request.</strong></p>
<p>
You can select one or more search fields: title, author, custom fields...</p>
<p>To start an advanced search:</p>
<ul><li><b>choose </b> first a <b>field</b> to search in from the drop-down menu. For example: Author</li>
<li>click on <b>Add</b> to display the first search field on your screen</li>
<li><b>select a search type</b> for the field you have just added. Choose from among the following - <b>"boolean expression", "starts with", "ends with" or "exactly like"</b> 
- the one that best corresponds to the type of search you want to conduct. Types of search may vary from field to field, e.g., for Author "starts with" </li>
<li><b>if the field needs a value</b>, <b>enter it</b> directly in the input box; if the field needs a choice (e.g. the material type), select one or more options by clicking and holding down the Ctrl button on your keyboard. E.g., for our Author, starts with "Shake"</li>
<li><b>Add any other criteria as you wish</b>. Following the above example, you could add Title exactly like "Othello".
<li>Then, confirm by clicking on <b>Search</b></li></ul>

<p>Your search can be a <a href=help.php?whatis=expbool>boolean expression</a>.</p>

<p>An advanced search can be carried out on the entire library catalogue database.</p>
